# Forge Overrides Directory
#
# This directory is reserved for any upstream crate overrides if absolutely necessary.
# Should remain empty initially - only use for conflicts that cannot be resolved
# through the composition pattern in forge-extensions/.
#
# When adding overrides here, update the root Cargo.toml [patch.crates-io] section.
