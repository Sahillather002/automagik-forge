# Files to MOVE to upstream (not delete) - 2 items

# 1. Logo component with theme-aware switching logic
forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/logo.tsx
  → Move to: upstream/frontend/src/components/logo.tsx
  → Reason: Theme-aware dark/light logo switching (lines 9-30)
  → Action: Copy logic to upstream, update paths/alt text during rebrand

# 2. Font variable definitions (partial)
forge-overrides/frontend/src/styles/index.css (lines 8-13 only)
  → Move to: upstream/frontend/src/styles/index.css
  → Content:
    --font-primary: 'Alegreya Sans', sans-serif;
    --font-secondary: 'Manrope', sans-serif;
  → Reason: Custom font variables needed by components
  → Action: Add these variables to upstream CSS

# REMOVED ITEMS (After Investigation):

# ❌ companion-install-task.ts - REMOVED
#   → Already exists in upstream with identical logic
#   → Only branding text differs (2 lines)
#   → Decision: KEEP in forge-overrides (Group B rebrand handles it)
#   → See: companion-task-investigation.md

# ❌ shims.d.ts - REMOVED
#   → Upstream compiles successfully without it (tested)
#   → TypeScript uses skipLibCheck: true in tsconfig
#   → Decision: DELETE from forge-overrides (not needed)
#   → See: shims-investigation-COMPLETE.md
