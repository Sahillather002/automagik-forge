# Task A - FINAL SUMMARY (After Investigation)

## Investigation Results

### ✅ companion-install-task.ts
**Question:** "WTF is this? I didn't develop this..."
**Answer:** **EXISTS in upstream!** Only 2 lines of branding text differ.
**Decision:** **KEEP in forge-overrides** (Group B rebrand script handles it)
**See:** companion-task-investigation.md

### ✅ shims.d.ts
**Question:** "What does it do? Do we need it?"
**Answer:** **NOT needed!** TypeScript `skipLibCheck: true` makes it unnecessary.
**Test:** Upstream compiles successfully without it (exit code 0)
**Decision:** **DELETE from forge-overrides**
**See:** shims-investigation-COMPLETE.md

## Key Changes After Investigation

### companion-install-task.ts
- **Before:** Listed as "move to upstream"
- **After:** KEEP in forge-overrides
- **Reason:** Already exists in upstream, Group B rebrand handles it

### shims.d.ts
- **Before:** Listed as "investigate, maybe move"
- **After:** DELETE
- **Reason:** Tested upstream compilation, confirmed not needed

### File Counts
- **DELETE:** 13 → 14 (+1 shims.d.ts)
- **KEEP:** 10 → 11 (+1 companion-install-task.ts)
- **MOVE:** 4 → 2 (-2 companion-task, -shims)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Investigations Complete**
   - companion-install-task.ts: Exists in upstream, keep as override
   - shims.d.ts: Not needed, delete

2. ⏳ **Human Review**
   - Review FINAL-SUMMARY.md
   - Approve updated categorization
   - Approve cleanup execution

3. ⏳ **Execute Cleanup**
   ```bash
   .genie/wishes/mechanical-rebrand/qa/group-a/cleanup.sh
   # Deletes 14 files
   # Keeps 11 files
   ```

4. ⏳ **Upstream Migration** (Separate task)
   - Move logo.tsx logic to upstream
   - Add font variables to upstream CSS

5. ⏳ **Verification**
   ```bash
   cargo check -p forge-app
   pnpm run check
   # Test Omni feature
   ```

## Success Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| All files categorized | ✅ 41 files analyzed |
| companion-task investigated | ✅ Found in upstream |
| shims.d.ts investigated | ✅ Tested, not needed |
| Cleanup script updated | ✅ 14 deletions, 11 kept |
| Frontend 50%+ reduction | ✅ 56% achieved |
| Backend analyzed | ✅ 16 files = 100% Omni |
| Upstream migration clear | ✅ 2 items documented |
| Build verification | ⏳ Pending execution |

## Conclusion

**All investigations complete. Ready for cleanup execution.**

- Only **Omni integration** is a real feature (24 files)
- **Dracula/Alucard themes** stay (1 file)
- **companion-install-task.ts** stays (Group B handles it)
- **shims.d.ts** deleted (proven unnecessary)
