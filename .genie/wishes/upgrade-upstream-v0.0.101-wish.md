## Discovery Summary
- **Primary analyst:** GENIE + Human
- **Key observations:**
  - Current upstream submodule at v0.0.95-20250924092007 (detached HEAD)
  - Latest available: v0.0.101-20251001171801 (6 versions behind)
  - 225+ files changed in upstream between versions
  - **NEW:** Overlay architecture implemented (commit 2fa77027, Oct 3 2025)
    - Frontend now uses Vite overlay resolver (forge-overrides/ â†’ upstream/)
    - `frontend/` is minimal (5 files), `forge-overrides/frontend/` currently empty
    - All UI currently pure upstream (no active customizations)
  - forge-extensions/branch-templates to be removed
  - forge-extensions/omni and forge-extensions/config are actively used, must keep
  - No forge-extensions/genie exists (was hallucinated reference)
  - No production data concerns - pre-release state allows fresh DB start

- **Assumptions (ASM-#):**
  - **ASM-1**: Upstream v0.0.101 is stable and production-ready
  - **ASM-2**: Overlay architecture (commit 2fa77027) is functional and complete
  - **ASM-3**: forge-extensions/omni and config are integrated and functional
  - **ASM-4**: Database schema can start fresh (no migration required)
  - **ASM-5**: Main branch is old direct fork - this branch is the future architecture
  - **ASM-6**: forge-overrides/frontend/ can stay empty (pure upstream UI acceptable for now)

- **Open questions (Q-#):**
  - **Q-1**: Are there breaking API changes in v0.96-v0.101 that affect forge-extensions?
  - **Q-2**: Does overlay resolver handle all upstream frontend changes automatically?
  - **Q-3**: Any branding customizations needed in forge-overrides/frontend/?
  - **Q-4**: Any runtime dependencies changed (Node, Rust, pnpm versions)?

- **Risks:**
  - **RISK-1**: Overlay resolver may fail with new upstream file structure
  - **RISK-2**: New upstream components may break forge-extensions/omni integration
  - **RISK-3**: Database schema changes may surface at runtime if migrations incomplete
  - **RISK-4**: Breaking API changes in 225+ files could affect forge-extensions
  - **RISK-5**: Build script (local-build.sh) references deleted frontend-forge package

## Executive Summary
Upgrade the upstream vibe-kanban submodule from v0.0.95 to v0.0.101 (6 versions, 225+ files), verify overlay architecture handles upstream changes, remove dead code (branch-templates extension), and fix build script. With the new overlay architecture (commit 2fa77027), frontend upgrades are automaticâ€”no manual file merging required.

## Current State
- **Upstream submodule:** v0.0.95-20250924092007 (Sept 2025)
  - @upstream/ git submodule tracked in @.gitmodules
  - Backend: Using upstream crates directly via Cargo workspace (@Cargo.toml)
  - Database: Custom `dev_assets/db.sqlite` with v0.95 schema

- **Frontend (NEW overlay architecture):** @frontend/
  - Minimal package: 5 files in src/ (App.tsx 930 lines, main.tsx, styles.css, etc.)
  - Vite overlay resolver: @forge-overrides/frontend/src/ â†’ @upstream/frontend/src/
  - Currently using pure upstream UI (forge-overrides/frontend/ is empty)
  - @frontend/vite.config.ts implements overlay pattern

- **Extensions:** @forge-extensions/
  - **omni/**: Notification system (KEEP - actively used)
  - **config/**: Forge config management (KEEP - actively used)
  - **branch-templates/**: Custom branch naming (DELETE - being removed)
  - **genie/**: Does not exist (was hallucinated reference)

- **Overrides:** @forge-overrides/
  - @forge-overrides/frontend/ exists but empty (future UI customizations)
  - .gitkeep placeholder retained

- **Gaps/Pain points:**
  - 6 versions behind upstream (missing features, bug fixes, security patches)
  - branch_template extension still present (needs deletion)
  - Build script broken: references deleted frontend-forge package
  - Cargo.toml ts-rs missing serde-json-impl feature (causes build failure)

## Target State & Guardrails
- **Desired behaviour:**
  - Upstream submodule at v0.0.101-20251001171801
  - Overlay architecture handles upstream frontend automatically
  - forge-overrides/frontend/ ready for future customizations (currently empty OK)
  - Clean workspace: only omni+config extensions remain
  - Fresh database with v0.0.101 schema
  - Build script fixed (no frontend-forge references)
  - All smoke tests passing (create project â†’ task â†’ attempt)

- **Non-negotiables:**
  - **Keep omni+config:** These extensions are functional and required
  - **No data loss:** Pre-release state, fresh DB acceptable
  - **Backend unchanged:** Use upstream crates directly (no local overrides)
  - **Overlay architecture:** Preserve Vite overlay resolver pattern
  - **Testable:** Must be able to run full development cycle
  - **Reversible:** Git allows rollback if critical issues found
