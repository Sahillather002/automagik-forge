| Submodule setup | .gitmodules | ✅ | Upstream at namastexlabs/vibe-kanban.git |
| Workspace structure | Cargo.toml | ✅ | forge-app + forge-extensions/* members |
| Done Reports | PR file list | ✅ | 13 implementor reports, 3 QA reports |

## Critical Issues

### 1. Test Failures (BLOCKING)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** forge-extensions/config/src/service.rs:201, :252

```
FAILED: forge_config::service::tests::round_trips_global_settings
FAILED: forge_config::service::tests::project_overrides_effective_omni_config
Error: no such table: forge_global_settings
```

**Impact:** Core configuration persistence broken. Tests expect `forge_global_settings` table that doesn't exist.

**Recommendation:**
1. Run migrations: `sqlx migrate run --source forge-app/migrations`
2. Verify test database setup in test fixtures
3. Add migration guard in tests or use in-memory DB with schema

### 2. Codex Review Feedback (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** frontend/src/components/omni/OmniCard.tsx:22-59

Codex identified type mismatch:
> Generated shared types remove the `omni` property from `Config`, but this component still reads `config.omni.*`. TypeScript compilation will fail.

**Impact:** Frontend-backend type contract broken. Runtime errors likely.

**Recommendation:**
1. Verify `shared/types.ts` generation: `cargo run -p server --bin generate_types`
2. Check `shared/forge-types.ts`: `cargo run -p forge-app --bin generate_forge_types`
3. Update OmniCard to use forge config APIs or revert type changes

### 3. Massive PR Scope (MODERATE)
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Scope:** 730 files, 65k insertions, 31k deletions

**Impact:**
- Review difficulty: Exceeds GitHub diff view limit (300 files)
- Merge risk: 100 files touched, difficult to isolate issues
- Rollback complexity: Single-commit reversion infeasible

**Recommendation:** Consider breaking into phases:
1. Phase A: Submodule + workspace structure
2. Phase B: Extension crates (omni, config, branch-templates)
3. Phase C: Genie framework migration
4. Phase D: Frontend overlay

## Deductions & Gaps

1. **-3 pts (Discovery):** Risk analysis incomplete - no documented rollback plan for 730-file change
2. **-1 pt (Discovery):** QA artifact paths not defined upfront
3. **-3 pts (Discovery):** No approval checkpoints before massive scope execution
4. **-5 pts (Implementation):** Excessive surface area - 730 files changed vs targeted extraction
5. **-5 pts (Implementation):** Test coverage incomplete - 2 critical failures, missing integration tests
6. **-2 pts (Implementation):** README not updated with new architecture
7. **-6 pts (Verification):** Validation commands not all passing (test failures block merge)
8. **-2 pts (Verification):** QA evidence incomplete (browser testing blocked)

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Merge)
1. **Fix test failures:** Resolve `forge_global_settings` table issue in forge-config tests
2. **Verify type generation:** Ensure Config/OmniCard type consistency across shared/types.ts
3. **Run full test suite:** `cargo test --workspace` must pass 100%
4. **Update README:** Document new architecture (upstream submodule, forge-extensions pattern)

### Short-term (Post-Merge Follow-ups)
1. **Split PR history:** Consider squash-merge with detailed commit message OR break into smaller PRs
2. **Add integration tests:** E2E tests for omni, branch-templates, config roundtrip
3. **Document rollback:** Create step-by-step rollback procedure given 730-file scope
4. **Complete QA checklist:** Run 11-point manual checklist with browser once environment allows

### Long-term (Architecture Hardening)
1. **Regression harness:** Implement `./scripts/run-forge-regression.sh` as documented in wish
2. **CI enhancements:** Add forge-config test DB setup, type generation validation
3. **Upstream sync drill:** Document and test `cd upstream && git pull` workflow
4. **Migration guide:** Write docs/runbooks/upstream-as-library-migration.md for future maintainers

## Verification Commands

### Tests (FAILING - Must Fix)
```bash
cargo test --workspace           # Current: 64 pass, 2 fail ❌
cargo test -p forge-config       # Must pass before merge ❌
```

### Type Generation (Unknown Status)
```bash
cargo run -p server --bin generate_types -- --check
cargo run -p forge-app --bin generate_forge_types -- --check
```

### Lint/Format (Likely Passing)
```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### Frontend (Not Validated)
```bash
cd frontend && pnpm run lint
cd frontend && pnpm run format:check
cd frontend && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

## Verdict

**Score: 72/100 (72%)**

⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE – Needs improvements before merge**

**Status:** BLOCKED

**Blockers:**
1. Test failures in forge-config (2 failing tests)
2. Codex-identified type mismatch (Config.omni)
3. CI test job pending (GitHub Actions)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Architecture vision sound (upstream-as-library pattern)
- ✅ Extension crates properly structured
- ✅ Submodule integration working
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation in .genie/
- ✅ Clean composition pattern in forge-app

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Test coverage incomplete (2 critical failures)
- ❌ Type contract broken (Config/OmniCard mismatch)
- ❌ Excessive scope (730 files) increases risk
- ❌ Missing integration/E2E tests
- ❌ QA checklist incomplete (browser-dependent)

## Next Steps

### Required Before Merge (Blocking)
1. Fix `forge_global_settings` table issue in forge-config tests
2. Resolve Config.omni type mismatch flagged by Codex
3. Verify `cargo test --workspace` passes 100%
4. Update README with architecture overview

### Recommended Before Merge (High Priority)
1. Run type generation validation commands
2. Execute frontend lint/type checks
3. Document rollback procedure for 730-file change
4. Add migration checklist to PR description

### Post-Merge Follow-ups (Medium Priority)
1. Complete 11-point manual QA checklist
2. Implement regression harness
3. Add integration tests for forge extensions
4. Create upstream sync documentation

### Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. Consider splitting future changes into smaller PRs
2. Add CI job for forge-config test DB setup
3. Create visual architecture diagrams
4. Write migration guide for other forks
