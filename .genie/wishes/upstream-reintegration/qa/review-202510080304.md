## Evidence Summary

| Artefact | Location | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Empty crates directory | crates/ | ✅ | Only . and .. present, all 7 duplicated crates removed |
| Upstream dependencies | forge-app/Cargo.toml:31-37 | ✅ | All 7 crates point to ../upstream/crates/* |
| Extension dependencies | forge-extensions/*/Cargo.toml | ✅ | omni and config point to ../../upstream/crates/* |
| Guardrail script | scripts/check-upstream-alignment.sh | ✅ | Executes successfully, verifies no duplication |
| Branch prefix override | forge-app/src/router.rs:127 | ✅ | Generates "forge/{task-id}" pattern |
| Omni migration | forge-app/migrations/20251008000001_forge_omni_tables.sql | ✅ | Clean 3-table schema on top of upstream |
| Workspace build | cargo build --workspace | ✅ | Finished in 0.25s, no errors |
| Forge app build | cargo build -p forge-app | ✅ | Finished in 0.31s, no errors |

## Deductions & Gaps

1. **-2 pts (Discovery):** Approval checkpoints not documented before implementation
2. **-3 pts (Implementation):** No unit tests for branch prefix logic or Omni table constraints
3. **-3 pts (Implementation):** No integration tests for worktree workflows or migration integrity
4. **-2 pts (Implementation):** Developer documentation not updated (onboarding, migration guides)
5. **-2 pts (Verification):** Edge cases not tested (worktree edge cases, branch collisions, rollback)
6. **-2 pts (Verification):** No runtime screenshots or performance metrics captured
7. **-2 pts (Verification):** Human approval pending for 5 validation items
8. **-1 pt (Verification):** 4 blockers remain unresolved (CI, docs, migration guide, runtime)

## Recommendations

### Critical (Required for EXCELLENT status)
1. **Add test coverage** for branch prefix generation (router.rs:127) and Omni table constraints
2. **Run full test suite** (`cargo test --workspace`) and capture results
3. **Obtain human approval** for pending validations (database init, app start, CI, frontend build)
4. **Update developer documentation** (README, onboarding docs, migration guide)

### Important (Improve robustness)
5. **Add integration tests** for worktree creation/cleanup workflows
6. **Test edge cases**: branch name collisions, migration rollback, orphaned worktrees
7. **Capture runtime evidence**: application startup logs, screenshots of working features
8. **Complete CI integration**: Add guardrail script to GitHub Actions workflow

### Optional (Excellence pursuit)
9. **Document approval checkpoints** for future wishes (template improvement)
10. **Capture performance metrics**: build times, database query performance
11. **Add migration rollback test** to verify database can be safely reverted

## Verification Commands

### Completed ✅
- `ls crates/` → Empty directory (only . and ..)
- `grep "upstream/crates" forge-app/Cargo.toml` → All 7 dependencies point to upstream
- `find forge-extensions -name "Cargo.toml" -exec grep -l "upstream/crates" {} \;` → omni and config verified
- `./scripts/check-upstream-alignment.sh` → ✅ Upstream alignment verified successfully
- `cargo build -p forge-app` → ✅ Finished in 0.31s
- `cargo build --workspace` → ✅ Finished in 0.25s

### Pending (Blocking EXCELLENT status)
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` → Not executed
- [ ] `cargo test -p forge-app` → Not executed
- [ ] Database initialization test → Not captured
- [ ] Application runtime test → Not captured
- [ ] `cd frontend && pnpm run build` → Not verified
- [ ] CI pipeline integration → Not completed

## Verdict

**Score: 83/100 (83%)**

- ✅ **90-100:** EXCELLENT – Ready for merge
- ✅ **80-89:** GOOD – Minor gaps, approved with follow-ups ← **CURRENT STATUS**
- ⚠️ **70-79:** ACCEPTABLE – Needs improvements before merge
- ❌ **<70:** NEEDS WORK – Significant gaps, blocked

**Status:** APPROVED_WITH_FOLLOWUPS

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required before COMPLETED status)
1. Run `cargo test --workspace` and document results
2. Test application startup: `cargo run -p forge-app --bin forge-app`
3. Verify frontend build: `cd frontend && pnpm run build`
4. Obtain human approval for runtime behavior

### Follow-Up Tasks (Track separately)
1. Add unit tests for router.rs:127 branch prefix logic
2. Add integration tests for Omni migration tables
3. Update developer onboarding documentation
4. Create migration guide for other Forge instances
5. Integrate guardrail script into GitHub Actions CI
6. Document approval checkpoint template for future wishes

### Update Wish
1. Update wish status to COMPLETED (after immediate steps)
2. Update completion score to 83/100
3. Append this review report to wish Status Log
4. Create follow-up tasks in project tracker for remaining gaps
