## Deductions & Gaps

### Critical Gaps (0 pts deducted)
None. All critical gaps from initial review (83/100) have been addressed.

### Important Gaps (-5 pts total)
1. **-1 pt (Implementation - Code Quality):** Database migration consolidation required extra iteration
   - Root cause: Initial migration approach created duplicates before cleanup
   - Impact: Minor - final implementation is clean
2. **-1 pt (Implementation - Documentation):** README not updated with new architecture
   - Root cause: DEVELOPER.md was prioritized over user-facing README
   - Impact: Low - developers have complete documentation in DEVELOPER.md
3. **-1 pt (Verification - Validation):** Database initialization not fully validated
   - Root cause: Application starts but schema init process not explicitly documented
   - Impact: Low - tests pass, suggesting DB is properly initialized
4. **-1 pt (Verification - Evidence Quality):** No performance benchmarks
   - Root cause: Focus on functional correctness over performance metrics
   - Impact: Low - acceptable for infrastructure change
5. **-1 pt (Verification - Review Thoroughness):** Final human approval pending
   - Root cause: Wish in IMPLEMENTED status, awaiting transition to COMPLETED
   - Impact: Procedural - blocks closure but not technical quality

### Minor Gaps (Not scored)
- Edge case testing for worktree collisions and migration rollbacks not present
- No before/after performance comparisons (build times, query performance)

## Recommendations

### Required for COMPLETED Status
1. **Human Approval**: Obtain explicit human sign-off to transition wish from IMPLEMENTED → COMPLETED
2. **Database Validation**: Document or demonstrate database initialization process explicitly

### Suggested Follow-Ups (Optional)
1. Update README.md with simplified architecture overview for end users
2. Add performance benchmarks for build times and database queries
3. Create edge case tests for worktree collision handling
4. Add migration rollback tests for safety validation

```bash
# Test suite (77 tests passing)
cargo test --workspace                          # ✅ All passing

# Code quality

## Verdict

**Score: 95/100 (95%)**
- ✅ **90-100:** EXCELLENT – Ready for merge

**Status:** APPROVED WITH FINAL SIGN-OFF REQUIRED

**Rationale:**
- All critical gaps from initial review (83/100) successfully addressed
- +12 points improvement through gap filling (test coverage, documentation, CI integration)
- Comprehensive test suite: 77 tests passing with 0 failures
- Clean architecture: upstream integration via path dependencies, no duplication
- Robust guardrails: automated alignment check in CI
- Complete documentation: architecture, dependency flow, guardrail usage
- Minor deductions (-5 pts) are acceptable for EXCELLENT rating:
  - Process gaps (human approval pending)
  - Nice-to-haves (README update, performance metrics)
  - Low-impact issues (extra iteration on migrations)

## Next Steps
