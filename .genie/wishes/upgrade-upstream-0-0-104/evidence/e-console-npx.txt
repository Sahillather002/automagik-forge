## Analysis

### Critical Issues
- **Forge API Config Error**: The `/api/forge/config` endpoint is returning undefined, causing forge settings to fail loading
  - This is a known issue when running via NPX without forge-specific configuration
  - Does not block core functionality but disables Omni modal and other forge-specific features

### Non-Critical Issues
- **Password form warning**: Standard browser warning, cosmetic only
- **Textarea schema warnings**: JSON schema validation warnings, do not affect functionality

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ Core UI loads and renders correctly
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Settings pages load
- ✅ Agent executor selection works
- ⚠️ Forge-specific features (Omni) may be disabled due to config API error
