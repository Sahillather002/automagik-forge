## Completed Work

### Task C-07: CreatePRDialog.tsx Refactoring

**File:** `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx`

**Upstream Equivalent:** `upstream/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx` (v0.0.105)

**Context:**
- Upstream submodule was uninitialized; ran `git submodule update --init upstream` to access v0.0.105 source
- Compared forge-override against upstream to identify customizations
- Found single customization: PR title branding

**Forge Customization Applied:**
- Line 42-43: Changed PR title suffix from `(vibe-kanban)` to `(automagik-forge)`
- Added comment: `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION: Brand PR titles with "automagik-forge" instead of "vibe-kanban"`

**Files Modified:**
- `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx` - Added customization comment

**Structure:**
- File already matched upstream v0.0.105 structure exactly
- Only difference was the branding string on line 42
- No structural refactoring needed

## Validation Results

### Lint Validation ✅
```bash
cd frontend && pnpm run lint
# Result: PASSED - No errors or warnings
```

### Forge Branding Verification ✅
```bash
grep "automagik-forge" forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx
# Result: Found 2 matches:
# 1. Comment: "// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION: Brand PR titles with "automagik-forge" instead of "vibe-kanban""
# 2. Code: setPrTitle(`${data.task.title} (automagik-forge)`);
```

## Evidence Location

- Modified file: `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx`
- Upstream reference: `upstream/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx` (commit ad1696cd)
- Lint output: Clean, no errors

## Deferred/Blocked Items

None - task completed successfully.

## Risks & Follow-ups

None identified. This was a minimal customization (single string change) with no functional impact beyond branding.

## Forge-Specific Notes

- Upstream submodule: v0.0.105-20251007161830 (commit ad1696cd)
- Dependencies: Installed via `pnpm install` (519 packages)
- Override drift: Minimal - only branding customization needed
- No type generation required (no Rust type changes)
- No database migration required

## Implementation Summary

Task C-07 completed successfully with minimal refactoring needed. The existing override already matched upstream structure; only required adding a documentation comment to mark the Forge customization explicitly. Validation passed cleanly.

**Effort:** XS (as estimated) - ~10 minutes
**Priority:** MEDIUM (as specified)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
