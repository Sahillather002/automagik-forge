## Completed Work

### Overview
Successfully refactored `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx` by copying the upstream v0.0.104 version as the base and layering minimal Forge customizations on top.

### Files Touched
- **Modified**: `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`
- **Modified**: `frontend/package.json` (added `simple-icons` dependency)

### Forge Customizations Applied

1. **Discord Guild ID** (line 30):
   - Changed from upstream: `1423630976524877857`
   - To Forge guild: `1095114867012292758`
   - Comment added: `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION: Automagik Forge Discord guild ID`

2. **Documentation Link** (line 42):
   - Changed from: `https://vibekanban.com/docs`
   - To: `https://forge.automag.ik/`
   - Comment added: `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION: Link to Automagik Forge documentation`

3. **Support/Issues Link** (line 48):
   - Changed from: `https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/issues`
   - To: `https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-forge/issues`
   - Comment added: `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION: Link to Automagik Forge issues`

### Commands Run

**Submodule Initialization:**
```bash
git submodule update --init upstream
# ✅ Success: Checked out fbb972a5828eb222e37fe387e7a48b54b4834477
```

**Dependency Installation:**
```bash
cd frontend && pnpm add simple-icons
# ✅ Success: Added simple-icons@15.16.1
```

**Linting:**
```bash
cd frontend && pnpm run lint
# ✅ Success: No linting errors in navbar.tsx
```

**Type Checking:**
```bash
cd frontend && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -i "navbar"
# ✅ Success: No TypeScript errors in navbar.tsx
```

**Verification:**
```bash
grep -n "1095114867012292758\|forge.automag.ik\|namastexlabs/automagik-forge" \
  forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
# ✅ Confirmed: All three Forge customizations present
```

## Key Changes from Old Override

### Additions (from upstream v0.0.104)
1. **Discord Widget**: Restored full Discord integration with online count
   - Import: `siDiscord` from `simple-icons`
   - Import: `useEffect, useState` from React
   - State: `onlineCount` with Discord API polling every 60s
   - UI: Discord badge next to logo showing "{count} online"

2. **Discord Dropdown Link**: Added Discord option to dropdown menu

3. **Improved Variable Naming**: Changed `active` to match variable name consistently

### Preserved from Old Override
1. Forge-specific external links (docs and support)
2. Minimal customization approach

### Structure
- Total lines: 248 (was 176 in old override)
- New imports: `useEffect`, `useState`, `siDiscord`, `MessageCircle`
- New state management: Discord online count fetching
- New UI element: Discord badge widget

## Evidence Location

### Validation Results
- Lint output: No errors (ran full `pnpm run lint` in frontend/)
- Type check: No errors in navbar.tsx (ran `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`)
- Forge customizations: Verified via grep (3 matches found)

### Dependencies
- `simple-icons@15.16.1` added to `frontend/package.json`

## Deferred/Blocked Items
None - all tasks completed successfully.

## Risks & Follow-ups

### Low Risk Items
- **Discord Widget Testing**: Discord widget needs manual browser testing to verify:
  - Online count displays correctly
  - Polling works (refreshes every 60s)
  - Fallback to "online" text works when API unavailable
  - Widget links to correct Discord server

- **Link Verification**: Manual verification needed:
  - `https://forge.automag.ik/` resolves correctly
  - `https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-forge/issues` is valid

### Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] Manual QA: Test Discord widget in running application
- [ ] Manual QA: Verify all external links work
- [ ] Manual QA: Screenshot navbar for wish evidence

## Implementation Notes

### Refactoring Approach
Per Task C-08 requirements (lines 518-540 in wish), this refactoring:
1. ✅ Copied upstream v0.0.104 as base (not merging old override)
2. ✅ Layered only essential Forge customizations
3. ✅ Added `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION:` comments (3 locations)
4. ✅ Maintained upstream structure (Discord widget fully restored)
5. ✅ Tested in isolation (lint + type check)

### Why Discord Widget Was Restored
The old Forge override (per diff sample) had completely removed the Discord widget and related imports. The upstream v0.0.104 includes a Discord widget with online count polling. Following the wish strategy to "prioritize upstream structure," we restored the full Discord implementation and simply updated the guild ID to Forge's.

### Drift Eliminated
Major drift bugs from old override:
- Missing Discord integration (upstream feature)
- Outdated variable names
- Missing imports for Discord functionality

All resolved by using upstream as base.

## Forge-Specific Notes

### Discord Configuration
- Guild ID: `1095114867012292758` (Forge guild)
- API endpoint: `https://discord.com/api/guilds/${DISCORD_GUILD_ID}/widget.json`
- Polling interval: 60 seconds
- Fallback behavior: Shows "online" when count unavailable

### Link Configuration
- Docs: `https://forge.automag.ik/`
- Support: `https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-forge/issues`
- Discord: `https://discord.gg/AC4nwVtJM3` (unchanged from upstream)

### Dependencies Added
- `simple-icons`: Required for Discord logo SVG path

## Final Status

✅ **Task Complete**: navbar.tsx refactored successfully
- Upstream v0.0.104 structure preserved
- Minimal Forge customizations applied (3 changes)
- All validation checks passed
- Ready for integration testing (Task D)
