# Commit Advisory – issue-creator

**Generated:** 2025-01-11T15:45:00Z

## Snapshot
- Branch: restructure/upstream-as-library-migration
- Related wish: Learning session for GitHub issue creation specialist

## Pre-commit Gate Results

**Checklist:** [lint, type, tests, docs, changelog, security, formatting]

**Status:**
- lint: ✅ pass (cargo clippy clean)
- type: ⚠️ n/a (frontend not accessible)
- tests: ⚠️ skipped (not run - would need `cargo test --workspace`)
- docs: ✅ pass (documentation added)
- changelog: n/a (not required for this change)
- security: ✅ pass (no security implications)
- formatting: ❌ **FAIL** (Rust formatting issues detected)

**Blockers:**
- Rust formatting needs to be applied in `forge-app/src/services/execution_monitor.rs`
- Rust formatting needs to be applied in `forge-app/src/services/mod.rs`
- Rust formatting needs to be applied in `forge-extensions/omni/src/client.rs`

**NextActions:**
1. Run `cargo fmt --all` to fix formatting issues
2. Review formatted changes
3. Consider running `cargo test --workspace` to ensure no regressions

**Verdict:** needs-fixes (confidence: high)

## Changes by Domain

### Agent Framework
- **New specialist agent**: `specialists/issue-creator` - Comprehensive GitHub issue creation with template awareness
- **AGENTS.md updates**: Added issue-creator to routing matrix and specialist enumeration
- **Learning report**: Documented learnings at `.genie/reports/learn-issue-creator-202501111530.md`

### Omni Service Integration
- **Execution monitor**: New background service to detect completed tasks and queue Omni notifications
- **Service improvements**: Enhanced error handling, UUID parsing, and metadata processing
- **Client updates**: Better logging and error responses

### Build & Configuration
- **Gitignore**: Added `frontend/public/ide/` for synced upstream assets
- **Build script**: Added asset sync functionality
- **Package.json**: Updated scripts configuration

### Frontend
- **Settings page**: Enhanced GeneralSettings component

## Risks & Follow-ups

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix formatting** - Run `cargo fmt --all` before committing
2. **Test execution monitor** - Verify the new background service works correctly
3. **Validate Omni integration** - Ensure notifications are properly queued

### Future Considerations
- Test the new issue-creator agent with different issue types
- Consider adding GitHub issue templates if not present
- Monitor execution_monitor performance with large task volumes
