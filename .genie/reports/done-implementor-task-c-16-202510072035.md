# Done Report: implementor-task-c-16-202510072035

## Task Context
**Task:** C-16 - AgentSettings.tsx override refactor
**Override File:** `forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx`
**Upstream File:** `upstream/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx`
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** XS

## Completed Work

### Discovery Phase
1. ✅ Initialized upstream submodule (`git submodule update --init upstream`)
2. ✅ Read override file (586 lines)
3. ✅ Read upstream file (586 lines)
4. ✅ Compared files using diff

### Findings
**Files are IDENTICAL** - No Forge-specific customizations exist in this override.

```bash
diff upstream/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx \
     forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx
# Output: (no differences)
```

### Action Taken
**Deleted unnecessary override file:**
```bash
rm forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx
```

**Rationale:**
- Override contained zero customizations
- Identical to upstream v0.0.105
- Removing allows upstream version to be used directly via Vite overlay resolver
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Follows Forge overlay architecture best practices

### Validation
✅ File diff showed zero differences
✅ Override file removed successfully
✅ Upstream file will now be used automatically via `forgeOverlayResolver` in vite.config.ts

## Evidence Location
- Diff output: No differences found
- Removed file: `forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx`
- Upstream file: `upstream/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx` (will be used)

## Files Touched
- **Deleted:** `forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx`

## Deferred/Blocked Items
None

## Risks & Follow-ups
None - straightforward file removal

## Commands Run
```bash
# Initialize submodule
git submodule update --init upstream

# Compare files
diff upstream/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx \
     forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx

# Remove unnecessary override
rm forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/AgentSettings.tsx
```

## Conclusion
**Task C-16: COMPLETE ✅**

AgentSettings.tsx override was identical to upstream and has been removed. The Vite overlay resolver will now use the upstream version directly, eliminating unnecessary duplication and reducing maintenance burden.

**Result:** -586 lines of redundant code, cleaner overlay architecture.
