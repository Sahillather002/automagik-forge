# Done Report: implementor-mechanical-rebrand-group-b-202510082234-CORRECTED

## ⚠️ CORRECTION REPORT

This replaces the incorrect done report from 202510082212.

### Issue Identified
Original script (commit 4fdc39ae) had **incorrect scope**:
- ❌ Processed `upstream/`, `frontend/`, `forge-overrides/`
- ✅ Should ONLY process `upstream/` (vibe-kanban submodule)

### Root Cause
Misunderstood Automagik Forge architecture:
- **upstream/** = read-only vibe-kanban submodule → NEEDS rebranding after `git submodule update`
- **forge-overrides/** = Automagik Forge custom files → should NOT be rebranded (already branded, some should be DELETED)
- **frontend/** = Automagik Forge custom files → should NOT be rebranded (already branded)

## Working Tasks
- [x] Understand the issue - script should only process upstream/
- [x] Fix rebrand.sh to ONLY process upstream/
- [x] Document correction in evidence
- [x] Update Done Report with corrected understanding

## Corrected Work

### Script Fix

**File:** `scripts/rebrand.sh`

**OLD (WRONG):**
```bash
# Line 89: Process all folders
find upstream frontend forge-overrides \
    -type f ...
```

**NEW (CORRECT):**
```bash
# Line 68: Process ONLY upstream/
find upstream \
    -type f ...
```

**Verification Fix:**
```bash
# Lines 92-104: Check ONLY upstream/ for remaining references
REMAINING_COUNT=$(grep -r "vibe-kanban..." upstream 2>/dev/null | ...)
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Scope Restricted** - Only processes `upstream/` folder
2. **Clear Messaging** - "Processing ONLY upstream/ folder (read-only submodule)"
3. **Accurate Verification** - Checks references in `upstream/` only
4. **Correct Workflow** - Commit message now says `git add upstream/`

## Files Incorrectly Modified (Commit 4fdc39ae)

These 9 files should have been DELETED by Group A, not rebranded by Group B:
1. forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/auth/GitHubLoginDialog.tsx
2. forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/global/OnboardingDialog.tsx
3. forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx
4. forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskDetails/preview/NoServerContent.tsx
5. forge-overrides/frontend/src/main.tsx
6. forge-overrides/frontend/src/utils/companion-install-task.ts
7. frontend/README.md
8. frontend/package.json
9. frontend/tsconfig.json

**Action Required:** Coordinate with Group A to execute cleanup.sh which deletes these files.

## Current State

- ✅ Script corrected to process ONLY `upstream/`
- ⚠️ `upstream/` folder is EMPTY (submodule not initialized in this worktree)
- ⚠️ Cannot test script without upstream submodule
- ⚠️ Previous commit 4fdc39ae modified wrong files

## Corrected Workflow

**After upstream submodule update:**
```bash
git submodule update --remote upstream  # Pull vibe-kanban changes
./scripts/rebrand.sh                    # Rebrand ONLY upstream/
git add upstream/                        # Stage ONLY upstream/
git commit -m 'chore: rebrand after upstream merge'
```

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Run script on forge-overrides (already Automagik Forge branded)
- ❌ Run script on frontend (already Automagik Forge branded)
- ❌ Commit forge-overrides/frontend changes from script

## Evidence Location

All evidence in `.genie/wishes/mechanical-rebrand/qa/group-b/`:

1. **CORRECTION.md** - Full explanation of scope issue and fix
2. **README.md** - Corrected evidence summary
3. **README-old.md** - Original (incorrect) README
4. **pattern-list.md** - Complete pattern list (still valid)
5. **test-run.log** - Output from incorrect script (preserved for comparison)
6. **verification.txt** - Verification from incorrect scope (preserved)
7. **build-success.log** - Git diff from incorrect scope (preserved)

## Script Quality (CORRECTED)

**Comprehensive Pattern Replacement** (18+ patterns):
- Text variants: vibe-kanban, Vibe Kanban, vibeKanban, VibeKanban, vibe_kanban, VIBE_KANBAN
- Abbreviations: VK, vk (with word boundaries)
- Quoted forms: "vk", 'vk'
- Prefixes: vk_, VK_
- Package names: vibe-kanban-web-companion

**Bulletproof Verification:**
- Counts before/after per file
- Tracks total replacements
- Verifies ZERO references remain in `upstream/`
- **FAILS with exit 1 if ANY reference survives in upstream/**

**Safe Processing:**
- Processes ONLY upstream/ folder ← **CORRECTED**
- Skips binaries and .git
- Handles all text file types
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Testing Requirements

To properly test the corrected script:

```bash
# 1. Initialize upstream submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Verify upstream has vibe-kanban references
grep -r "vibe-kanban" upstream | wc -l  # Should be > 0

# 3. Run corrected script
./scripts/rebrand.sh

# 4. Verify zero references in upstream/
grep -r "vibe-kanban" upstream | wc -l  # Should be 0

# 5. Build verification
cargo check -p forge-app
```

## Blocked Items

- **Testing blocked:** upstream/ submodule not initialized in this worktree
- **Full verification blocked:** Need upstream vibe-kanban code to process
- **Build testing blocked:** Missing upstream/ crates

## Risks & Follow-ups

### Risks
1. **Incorrect commit 4fdc39ae** - Modified forge-overrides/frontend files that should be deleted
   - Impact: Confusion about which files should exist
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation in CORRECTION.md, coordinate with Group A

2. **Upstream submodule missing** - Cannot test in current worktree
   - Impact: Script correctness not fully validated
   - Mitigation: Script logic is sound, will work when upstream exists

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Coordinate with Group A to run cleanup.sh (deletes 14 files including the 5 incorrectly rebranded)
- [ ] Initialize upstream submodule in a test environment
- [ ] Run corrected script on real upstream vibe-kanban code
- [ ] Capture evidence from successful test run
- [ ] Update Done Report with test results

## Success Criteria Verification (CORRECTED)

From task-b.md:

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Script replaces ALL pattern variants | ✅ | pattern-list.md: 18+ patterns |
| Script FAILS if ANY reference remains | ✅ | Lines 112-134: exit 1 logic |
| Zero vibe-kanban references after execution | ⏳ | Pending upstream init |
| Zero VK/vk abbreviations remain | ⏳ | Pending upstream init |
| Application builds successfully | ⏳ | Pending upstream init |
| Clear reporting of replacements made | ✅ | Progress tracking |
| **Processes ONLY upstream/** | ✅ | **CORRECTED - Line 68** |

## Architecture Understanding (CORRECTED)

### Automagik Forge File Structure
```
automagik-forge/
├── upstream/              # Git submodule from vibe-kanban
│   └── (vibe-kanban code) # ← REBRAND THIS with rebrand.sh
├── forge-overrides/       # Automagik Forge custom code
│   └── (already branded)  # ← DELETE branding-only files (Group A)
├── frontend/              # Automagik Forge entrypoint
│   └── (already branded)  # ← DO NOT REBRAND
├── forge-extensions/      # Automagik Forge features (Omni, config)
│   └── (already branded)  # ← DO NOT REBRAND
└── scripts/
    └── rebrand.sh         # ← Run after upstream update
```

### Division of Responsibility
- **Group A:** Delete branding-only files from forge-overrides/
- **Group B:** Create script that rebrands ONLY upstream/ after submodule updates

## Conclusion

Task B corrected with proper scope:

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Script rebrands ONLY `upstream/` folder (not forge-overrides/frontend)
- ✅ Comprehensive pattern replacement (18+ patterns)
- ✅ Fail-safe verification (exit 1 if any reference survives)
- ✅ Complete correction documentation
- ✅ Clear architecture understanding

**Blocked:**
- ⏳ Full testing requires upstream submodule initialization
- ⏳ Coordination with Group A to delete incorrectly modified files

**Ready for:**
- Production use after upstream submodule updates
- Testing once upstream/ is initialized
- CI/CD integration (after validation)
