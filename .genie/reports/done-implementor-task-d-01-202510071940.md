# Done Report: Task D-01 - Omni Extension Validation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully validated forge-omni extension against v0.0.105 upstream. All compilation, tests, and linting passed. Fixed one clippy lint issue (derivable Default impl). Type generation confirmed Omni types are correctly exported.

## Work Completed
- Submodules initialized: YES (critical for worktree isolation)
- Compilation: SUCCESS (4m 43s build time)
- Tests: PASSED (4/4 unit tests)
- Clippy: CLEAN (after fixing derivable_impls lint)
- Type generation: SUCCESS (OmniConfig, RecipientType, OmniInstance confirmed in shared/forge-types.ts)

## Files Modified
- `forge-extensions/omni/src/types.rs:12` - Added `Default` derive to `OmniConfig` struct (removed manual impl per clippy recommendation)

## Breaking Changes Found
None. The forge-omni extension compiled cleanly against v0.0.105 dependencies with only a minor lint fix required.

- Tests: @.genie/wishes/upgrade-upstream-0-0-104/evidence/d-01-test.txt
- Clippy: @.genie/wishes/upgrade-upstream-0-0-104/evidence/d-01-clippy.txt

## Validation Results

### Submodule Initialization
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
# ✅ Successfully initialized research/automagik-genie and upstream/
```

### Compilation
```bash
cargo build -p forge-omni
# ✅ Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4m 43s
```

### Tests
```bash
cargo test -p forge-omni
# ✅ running 4 tests
# test types::tests::test_raw_instance_conversion ... ok
# test types::tests::test_omni_config_defaults ... ok
# test types::tests::test_recipient_type_serialization ... ok
# test types::tests::test_send_text_request_serialization ... ok
# test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

### Clippy
```bash
cargo clippy -p forge-omni -- -D warnings
# ⚠️ Initial run: 1 error (clippy::derivable_impls)
# ✅ After fix: Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.85s
```

### Type Generation
```bash
cargo run -p forge-app --bin generate_forge_types -- --check
# ✅ Forge types up to date
# Confirmed exports: OmniConfig, RecipientType, OmniInstance
```

## Blockers
None

## Next Steps
- Task D-01 validation complete
- Ready to proceed with Task D-02 (Config Extension Validation)
- All forge-omni extension files validated against v0.0.105
