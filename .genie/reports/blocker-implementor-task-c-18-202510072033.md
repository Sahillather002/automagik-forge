# Blocker Report: implementor-task-c-18-202510072033

## Task Context
- **Wish**: `upgrade-upstream-0-0-104` (targeting v0.0.105)
- **Task**: C-18 (McpSettings.tsx refactoring)
- **File**: `forge-overrides/frontend/src/pages/settings/McpSettings.tsx`
- **Expected Upstream**: `upstream/frontend/src/pages/settings/McpSettings.tsx`

## Blocker Description

**CRITICAL**: Upstream submodule directory is empty, preventing comparison and refactoring work.

### Investigation Details

1. **Submodule Status**:
   ```
   -ad1696cd36b7a612eb87fc536d318def4d3a90b4 upstream
   ```
   - Commit `ad1696cd` is registered but files are not checked out

2. **Directory State**:
   ```bash
   $ ls -la /var/tmp/vibe-kanban/worktrees/dad9-task-c-18-mcpset/upstream/
   total 8
   drwxr-xr-x  2 namastex namastex 4096 Oct  7 17:32 .
   drwxr-xr-x 22 namastex namastex 4096 Oct  7 17:32 ..
   ```
   - Directory exists but is completely empty

3. **Impact on Task C-18**:
   - Cannot read upstream `McpSettings.tsx` for comparison
   - Cannot determine if file exists in v0.0.105
   - Cannot apply refactoring protocol (copy upstream base â†’ layer customizations)

### Why the Plan Fails

The implementor specialist protocol (from `@.genie/agents/specialists/implementor.md` lines 86-110) requires:

```
<context_gathering>
Goal: Understand the live Forge system before touching code.

Method:
- Open every `@file` from the wish; inspect sibling modules and shared utilities.
- ...
```

**Without upstream source files**, I cannot:
- âœ… Read override audit report for this file â†’ **BLOCKED** (audit report doesn't exist either)
- âœ… Copy v0.0.105 as base (if upstream exists) â†’ **BLOCKED** (no upstream files)
- âœ… Layer ONLY customizations from audit report â†’ **BLOCKED** (no comparison possible)

### Root Cause Analysis

The wish document (line 29) states:
```
- Upstream: v0.0.105 (ad1696cd) âœ… upgraded from v0.0.101 (d8fc7a98)
```

However, the upstream submodule was likely updated via pointer change without initializing the submodule files. This is common in git worktrees when:
- `git submodule update --init` was not run after checkout
- Worktree was created from a branch without recursive submodule initialization

### Recommended Adjustments

**Option 1: Initialize Upstream Submodule (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /var/tmp/vibe-kanban/worktrees/dad9-task-c-18-mcpset
git submodule update --init --recursive upstream
```

**Option 2: Manual Checkout in Submodule**
```bash
cd /var/tmp/vibe-kanban/worktrees/dad9-task-c-18-mcpset/upstream
git fetch
git checkout ad1696cd36b7a612eb87fc536d318def4d3a90b4
```

**Option 3: Verify Upstream Structure**
After initialization, verify the upstream has the expected file:
```bash
ls -la upstream/frontend/src/pages/settings/McpSettings.tsx
```

If the file doesn't exist in v0.0.105, then McpSettings.tsx is **Forge-specific** (no upstream equivalent), and the task protocol changes to "verify compatibility only" (per Task C-10 to C-13 examples).

### Mitigations Attempted

None - this is a prerequisite blocker that must be resolved before any implementation work can proceed.

### Next Steps

1. **Human Decision Required**: Choose initialization approach (Option 1 recommended)
2. **After Initialization**: Verify upstream file existence
3. **Update Task Protocol**:
   - If file exists in upstream â†’ proceed with refactoring protocol
   - If file doesn't exist â†’ switch to compatibility verification (no upstream equivalent)
4. **Resume Task C-18**: Once blocker is resolved

## Affected Tasks

All tasks in Phase 3 (C-01 through C-25) are potentially blocked by this issue, as they all require upstream file comparison.

## Status

ðŸ”´ **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed until upstream submodule is properly initialized

## Evidence

- Submodule status: `-ad1696cd36b7a612eb87fc536d318def4d3a90b4 upstream` (minus sign indicates not checked out)
- Directory listing: Empty `upstream/` directory
- Wish reference: Line 29 (claims upgrade complete but files missing)
