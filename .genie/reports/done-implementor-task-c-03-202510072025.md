# Done Report: implementor-task-c-03-202510072025

## Working Tasks
- [x] Read current override implementation
- [x] Compare with upstream v0.0.105 equivalent
- [x] Identify Forge customizations (branding only)
- [x] Add `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION:` comment documenting the change
- [x] Verify file structure matches upstream patterns

## Completed Work

### File Analysis
**File:** `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/global/OnboardingDialog.tsx`
**Upstream:** `upstream/frontend/src/components/dialogs/global/OnboardingDialog.tsx`
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ✅ Refactored

### Findings
The Forge override was already properly structured - based on upstream v0.0.105 with minimal customization:

**Single Forge Customization:**
- Line 73-74: Dialog title changed from "Welcome to Vibe Kanban" to "Welcome to Automagik Forge"

### Implementation Details
**Change Made:**
- Added documentation comment above the customized line:
  ```tsx
  {/* FORGE CUSTOMIZATION: Branding - "Automagik Forge" instead of "Vibe Kanban" */}
  <DialogTitle>Welcome to Automagik Forge</DialogTitle>
  ```

**Why Minimal Changes:**
- File structure identical to upstream
- All functionality preserved
- Only branding text differs
- No drift from upstream patterns

### Validation Status
✅ **File Structure:** Matches upstream v0.0.105 exactly (except documented branding)
✅ **Customization Documented:** `// FORGE CUSTOMIZATION:` comment added
✅ **TypeScript Syntax:** Valid (no syntax errors)
⚠️ **Lint Validation:** Deferred (worktree lacks node_modules; validation will occur in main integration testing)

## Evidence Location
- Modified file: `forge-overrides/frontend/src/components/dialogs/global/OnboardingDialog.tsx`
- Upstream reference: `upstream/frontend/src/components/dialogs/global/OnboardingDialog.tsx` (commit ad1696cd)
- Diff summary: +1 comment line documenting Forge branding customization

## Deferred/Blocked Items
None - task completed successfully.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- [ ] Lint validation should be performed during Phase 4 integration testing (Task D)
- [ ] Visual regression test should confirm onboarding dialog renders correctly with Forge branding

## Task-Specific Notes
**Upstream Comparison:**
- Upstream version (v0.0.105): Uses "Welcome to Vibe Kanban"
- Forge override: Uses "Welcome to Automagik Forge" (line 74)
- All other code identical (imports, state management, form handling, validation logic)

**Refactoring Assessment:**
- Override already followed best practices (copied from upstream, minimal changes)
- No drift detected
- No additional refactoring needed beyond documentation comment

**Success Criteria Met:**
✅ Forge customizations preserved (welcome message branding)
✅ File structure matches upstream
✅ Customization documented with comment
✅ No unnecessary drift introduced
