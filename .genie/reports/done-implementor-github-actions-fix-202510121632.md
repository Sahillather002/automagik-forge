# Done Report: GitHub Actions Binary Packaging Fix

**Agent**: implementor
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-12 16:32 UTC
**Issue**: #1 - Wrong Binary in GitHub Actions (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Scope

Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to package the correct `forge-app` binary instead of the outdated `server` binary on all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- **`.github/workflows/build-all-platforms.yml`**

### Specific Changes

#### Windows Packaging (Line 161)
**Before:**
```yaml
Copy-Item "target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/server.exe" "automagik-forge.exe"
```

**After:**
```yaml
Copy-Item "target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/forge-app.exe" "automagik-forge.exe"
```

#### Linux/macOS Packaging (Line 177)
**Before:**
```bash
cp target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/server automagik-forge
```

**After:**
```bash
cp target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/forge-app automagik-forge
```

## Validation Performed

1. ✅ Read the workflow file to confirm current state
2. ✅ Applied both changes (Windows and Linux/macOS paths)
3. ✅ Verified changes by re-reading the modified sections
4. ✅ Confirmed both binary paths now reference `forge-app` instead of `server`

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- Published NPM releases now include the correct Forge-extended binary
- All Forge extensions (omni, config, branch-templates) are properly included in releases
- All platforms (Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64) package the correct binary

## Commands Run

```bash
# Validation
cat -n .github/workflows/build-all-platforms.yml | grep -A 5 "Package binaries"
```

**Result**: Both Windows and Linux/macOS packaging steps now correctly reference `forge-app` binary.

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/build-all-platforms.yml` (2 lines changed)

## Risks & Follow-ups

### Risks
- **None identified**: This is a straightforward path correction with no side effects

### Follow-ups
1. Next GitHub release will need to be tested to confirm binaries include Forge extensions
2. Consider adding a CI validation step that checks for the existence of `forge-app` binary before packaging
3. Remaining Makefile issues (#2-#7) still need to be addressed by other implementors

## Human Follow-ups Required

None - this change is complete and ready for commit.
