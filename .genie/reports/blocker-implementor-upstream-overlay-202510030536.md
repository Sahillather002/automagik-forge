# Blocker Report: implementor-upstream-overlay-202510030536

## Context Investigated
- Loaded wish context @.genie/wishes/upstream-overlay-wish.md.
- Reviewed expected Group A output @.genie/reports/done-implementor-upstream-overlay-202502161530.md (missing in repo).
- Inspected current overlay configuration in @frontend/vite.config.ts and @frontend/tsconfig.json.

## Blocker Summary
The planned file migration (Group B) assumes Group A completed the overlay wiring so that files moved into `forge-overrides/frontend/src/` shadow upstream `frontend/src/`. Current `frontend` tooling still resolves imports exclusively from `frontend/src/` and has no alias/path mapping for `forge-overrides`. Moving the listed files would leave the app without these modules, breaking builds immediately.

### Evidence
- `@frontend/vite.config.ts` lacks any alias/plugin logic to read from `forge-overrides`.
- `@frontend/tsconfig.json` defines paths only for `./src` and `../shared`, no overlay path.
- `@forge-overrides/` directory is empty.
- Referenced Group A Done Report is absent, suggesting overlay work has not landed yet.

## Recommended Adjustments
1. Confirm whether Group A overlay implementation exists on another branch or needs to be rerun.
2. Once overlay aliases are in place (vite + tsconfig + dev server), re-attempt Group B migration.
3. Provide the actual path (Done Report or task notes) containing overlay configuration details so migration can align with validated approach.

## Mitigations Attempted
- Searched repository for `forge-overrides` usage (`rg "forge-overrides" -n`) â€“ none found.
- Verified Vite + TypeScript configs; confirmed absence of overlay integration.

## Next Steps Needed From Humans
- Share or land the overlay configuration prior to moving files, or revise Group B scope to include that work.
- Confirm new reference Done Report path if it lives elsewhere.

Once overlay tooling is available, I can proceed with file migration and validation.
