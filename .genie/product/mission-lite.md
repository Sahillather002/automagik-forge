# Product Mission (Lite)

Automagik Forge is the Vibe Coding++™ platform where human developers orchestrate AI coding agents through a persistent kanban board. Plan tasks yourself or with AI help, experiment with multiple agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, open-source models), review changes in isolated git worktrees, and ship code you actually understand.

**The 2-Week Curse Solution:** Stop shipping mysterious AI code that breaks later. With Forge, you maintain control, understand every change, and experiment until you find what works - then merge with confidence.

100% open-source • Self-hostable • No vendor lock-in
