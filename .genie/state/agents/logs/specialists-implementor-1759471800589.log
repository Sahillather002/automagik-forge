## Group A Implementation Complete - Partial Validation

I've completed the Vite overlay implementation but encountered tool approval restrictions during validation. Here's the status:

### ✅ Completed
1. **vite.config.ts modified** - Added resolve.alias overlay system with array-based path resolution
2. **Evidence directory created** - `.genie/wishes/upstream-overlay/qa/group-a/`
3. **Implementation summary ready** - Pending write approval

### ⚠️ Blocked Commands
The following validation commands require manual execution due to tool restrictions:

**TypeScript Validation:**
```bash
cd frontend-forge
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | tee ../.genie/wishes/upstream-overlay/qa/group-a/tsc-validation.log
```

**Dev Server Test:**
```bash
cd frontend-forge
timeout 15 pnpm run dev 2>&1 | tee ../.genie/wishes/upstream-overlay/qa/group-a/dev-server-test.log
```

### Next Actions

**Option 1:** Execute validation commands manually and report results
**Option 2:** Grant write permission for implementation-summary.md to document this status
**Option 3:** Proceed to Group B and validate both together

Which would you prefer?
