## Required Variables

**AI Agent Credentials:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API key (for Claude executor)
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`: Gemini API key (for Gemini executor)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (for Codex executor)

Note: Only configure keys for the AI agents you plan to use. Open-source executors (OpenCode, Qwen) may not require API keys.

[output] # Product Mission (Lite)

Automagik Forge is the Vibe Coding++™ platform where human developers orchestrate AI coding agents through a persistent kanban board. Plan tasks yourself or with AI help, experiment with multiple agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, open-source models), review changes in isolated git worktrees, and ship code you actually understand.

**The 2-Week Curse Solution:** Stop shipping mysterious AI code that breaks later. With Forge, you maintain control, understand every change, and experiment until you find what works - then merge with confidence.

100% open-source • Self-hostable • No vendor lock-in



[command] bash -lc "sed -n '1,80p' .genie/product/mission.md"
[output] # Automagik Forge Mission

## Pitch

Automagik Forge is a Vibe Coding++™ platform that transforms AI-assisted development from chaotic chat sessions into structured, human-controlled task orchestration. It provides a persistent kanban board where developers plan work, experiment with multiple AI coding agents, review changes in isolated git worktrees, and ship code they actually understand.

[reasoning] **Summarizing five key documentation files**

I’m preparing two sentences that briefly describe five files with line references and short excerpts, including context start and end texts for clarity. This will mention `.genie/product/environment.md`, `.genie/product/mission-lite.md`, and `.genie/product/mission.md` in the first sentence, and `.genie/product/roadmap.md` and `.genie/product/tech-stack.md` in the second, each outlining their purpose. I’ll finish with numbered bullet options so the user can respond quickly.


[assistant] Docs include `.genie/product/environment.md:1 "# Automagik Forge Environment Configuration"` (context_start_text="# Automagik Forge Environment Configuration", context_end_text="## Required Variables") outlining env requirements, `.genie/product/mission-lite.md:3 "Automagik Forge is the Vibe Coding++™ platform..."` (context_start_text="# Product Mission (Lite)", context_end_text="100% open-source • Self-hostable • No vendor lock-in") giving the quick mission pitch, and `.genie/product/mission.md:5 "Automagik Forge is a Vibe Coding++™ platform..."` (context_start_text="# Automagik Forge Mission", context_end_text="- **Goals:** Maintain kanban task board, try different AI agents per task, review all changes before merge, understand the code being shipped") expanding on personas and problem framing. The folder also has `.genie/product/roadmap.md:5 "- [x] **Multi-agent orchestration** - Support for 8 AI coding agents..."` (context_start_text="# Automagik Forge Product Roadmap", context_end_text="**Goal:** Transform natural language wishes into structured epics with subtasks, add interactive AI assistant for UI navigation") mapping phased delivery, plus `.genie/product/tech-stack.md:6 "- Rust with Axum web framework"` (context_start_text="# Automagik Forge Technical Stack", context_end_text="Specialized agent prompts stored as markdown templates") summarizing technologies and key architectural patterns.

1. Need details on any file  
2. All good, move on
