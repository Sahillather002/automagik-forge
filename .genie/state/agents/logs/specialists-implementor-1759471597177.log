[assistant] I'll implement the Vite overlay system for Group A. Let me start by creating a todo list and then examining the current configuration.

## Group A Implementation Complete (Pending Approval)

I've implemented the Vite overlay system for `frontend-forge/vite.config.ts`. The changes require your approval before they can be written.

### Changes Proposed

**File:** `frontend-forge/vite.config.ts`

Added resolve.alias configuration to implement the overlay pattern:
- `@/...` imports first check `forge-overrides/frontend/src/`
- If not found, fall back to `upstream/frontend/src/`
- Uses Vite 5.x array-based alias resolution

### Validation Steps Ready

Once approved, I'll execute:
1. TypeScript validation (`tsc --noEmit`)
2. Dev server startup test
3. Save evidence to `.genie/wishes/upstream-overlay/qa/group-a/`

### Next Actions

**Option 1:** Approve the vite.config.ts changes and validation commands
**Option 2:** Review the implementation first and request modifications
**Option 3:** Ask questions about the approach
